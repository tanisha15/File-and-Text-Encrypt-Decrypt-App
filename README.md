# File and Text Encrypt/Decrypt App
Based on the simple Caeser Cipher algorithm which involves replacing the letters of the alphabet with the letter three places down the current letter and the AES encryption which involves the use of a secret key to decipher the text stored in the file.

## Features of the project:
* Involves the use of tkinter package for creating the GUI window for the user to interact.
* The `plaintext` variable stores the original text and is converted to the `ciphertext` to store the encrypted version of the file.
* The `ciphertext` can be converted back to the `plaintext` to get the decrypted file.
* The GUI buttons are created as follows:
1. `load` is used to get the text file from the user in the txt format.
2. `encrypt` is used to encrypt the loaded file with .enc extension.
3. `decrypt` is used to get back the original text.
* This python gui app can be very useful to protect any sensitive file of the user.
* Another program is also created to find the encrypted and decrypted versions of any word given by the user using caeser cipher algorithm.

## Pre-requisites:
* Python 3 installed
* `pycryptodome` package installed
* `tkinter` package installed
* The file to be uploaded should be in `txt` format.
